<p><strong>Shellnoise is inspired by antirez/linenoise and the UTF-8 extensions
made by yhirose. Shellnoise uses linenoise as the foundation for a 
simple, single header library for making shells</strong></p>

<p>This should be ready to go by 01-Mar-2016, but <em>should always be 
considered beta code until you test it thoroughly yourself</em>.</p>

<p>Shellnoise was created to enable me to quickly develop a new command 
processor for any library for manual testing and executing funcitons.
Shellnoise is licensed under the same BSD license as Redis and linenoise.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong> is the code since only programmers are going to use this 
anyway (I've never read a single char of documentation on linenoise other
than the code ;-)</p>

<p><strong>For a quickstart please see:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/blob/master/example.c">https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/blob/master/example.c</a></p>

<p><strong>To use this system:</strong></p>

<p>'#include shellnoise.h' in your code</p>

<p>compile shellnoise.c in your make file</p>

<p>and build your a.out with shellnoise.o</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>create a static (or dynamic) library </p>

<p>'#include shellnoise.h' in your code</p>

<p>and link with <code>-lshellnoise</code></p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>merge shellnoise.h and shellnoise.c into a single file header
compilation unit and use that as shellnoise.o in your makefile</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>If you want C++, please see: </p>

<p>'<a href="https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-linenoise">https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-linenoise</a>'</p>

<p>Be aware that the above is only linenoise with UTF-8 extensions but you
are welcome to raid this project and make a shellnoise.cpp! Just use
shellnoise.h as a guide of what to include. </p>

<p>This would be a good project! Please let me know if you do. I don't 
really use C++ at all anymore but lots &amp; lots of people do.</p>
