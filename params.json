{"name":"Shellnoise","tagline":"A simple shell library based on antirez/linenoise","body":"#shellnoise#\r\n\r\n**Shellnoise is inspired by antirez/linenoise and the UTF-8 extensions\r\nmade by yhirose. Shellnoise uses linenoise as the foundation for a \r\nsimple, single header library for making shells**\r\n\r\nThis should be ready to go by 01-Mar-2016, but _should always be \r\nconsidered beta code until you test it thoroughly yourself_.\r\n\r\nShellnoise was created to enable me to quickly develop a new command \r\nprocessor for any library for manual testing and executing funcitons.\r\nShellnoise is licensed under the same BSD license as Redis and linenoise.\r\n\r\n**Documentation** is the code since only programmers are going to use this \r\nanyway (I've never read a single char of documentation on linenoise other\r\nthan the code ;-)\r\n\r\n**For a quickstart please see:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/antirez/linenoise/blob/master/example.c\r\n\r\n\r\n**To use this system:**\r\n\r\n'#include shellnoise.h' in your code\r\n\r\ncompile shellnoise.c in your make file\r\n\r\nand build your a.out with shellnoise.o\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\ncreate a static (or dynamic) library \r\n\r\n'#include shellnoise.h' in your code\r\n\r\nand link with `-lshellnoise`\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\nmerge shellnoise.h and shellnoise.c into a single file header\r\ncompilation unit and use that as shellnoise.o in your makefile\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\nIf you want C++, please see: \r\n\r\n'https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-linenoise'\r\n\r\nBe aware that the above is only linenoise with UTF-8 extensions but you\r\nare welcome to raid this project and make a shellnoise.cpp! Just use\r\nshellnoise.h as a guide of what to include. \r\n\r\nThis would be a good project! Please let me know if you do. I don't \r\nreally use C++ at all anymore but lots & lots of people do.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
