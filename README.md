#shellnoise#

**Shellnoise is inspired by antirez/linenoise and the UTF-8 extensions
made by yhirose. Shellnoise uses linenoise as the foundation for a 
simple, single header library for making shells**

This should be ready to go by 01-Mar-2016, but _should always be 
considered beta code until you test it thoroughly yourself_.

Shellnoise was created to enable me to quickly develop a new command 
processor for any library for manual testing and executing funcitons.
Shellnoise is licensed under the same BSD license as Redis and linenoise.

**Documentation** is the code since only programmers are going to use this 
anyway (I've never read a single char of documentation on linenoise other
than the code ;-)

**For a quickstart please see:**

https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/blob/master/example.c


**To use this system:**

'#include shellnoise.h' in your code

compile shellnoise.c in your make file

and build your a.out with shellnoise.o

**OR**

create a static (or dynamic) library 

'#include shellnoise.h' in your code

and link with `-lshellnoise`

**OR**

merge shellnoise.h and shellnoise.c into a single file header
compilation unit and use that as shellnoise.o in your makefile

**OR**

If you want C++, please see: 

'https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-linenoise'

Be aware that the above is only linenoise with UTF-8 extensions but you
are welcome to raid this project and make a shellnoise.cpp! Just use
shellnoise.h as a guide of what to include. 

This would be a good project! Please let me know if you do. I don't 
really use C++ at all anymore but lots & lots of people do.
